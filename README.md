# Network-Automation

This is the first version of my network automation program. You can add the values for each type of configuration and it will issue the command for you.


**List of supported devices are:**
- Cisco IOS Switches

**List of supported configurations are:**
- making vlans
- assign each interface to a vlan
- change the interface switchport to access or trunk
  
I defined the .csv files based on my another project that I implemented in GNS3, you can find the project [here](https://github.com/tofonjvd/GNS3_vlan_interface_ssh_mac_copy__practice)


This list will get more updates in future.

Good configing !
