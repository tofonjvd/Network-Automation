# Network-Automation

This is the first version of my network automation program. You can add the values for each type of configuration and it will issue the command for you.

The list of supported devices are:
  Cisco IOS Switches
  
and the list of supported configurations are:
  making vlans
  assign each interface to a vlan
  change the interface switchport to access or trunk
  
I defined the .csv files based on my another project that I implemented in GNS3, you can find it in the link down below:
https://github.com/tofonjvd/GNS3_vlan_interface_ssh_mac_copy__practice

This list will get more updates in future.

Good configing !
